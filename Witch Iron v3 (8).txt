Mutation
Your Corruption sinks in, and your body mutates. When you gain a Mutation, reduce your Willpower by 10 & remove all Corruption. Should your Willpower ever be reduced to zero, you become an NPC as a servant of the Dark Gods.
Mutations are not listed with stats; they grant whatever benefit makes sense, which could be a +2 Hits to a type of Check, d6 as your Hits for special abilities, weapons, armor, movement, or anything else you can think of.
