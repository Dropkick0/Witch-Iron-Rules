Faith
When you want to cast a spell, you must request the power of your God and channel it to your desired effect. Using an action to Cast, roll up to your Magick/ Faith in d10s. If the result is equal to or greater than the miracle’s Casting Hits, it is cast successfully. If the result is less than the miracle’s CH, you may continue to make Cast Checks in an Extended Check until a miracle is finished.
Cruel Gods
When a die rolls a ten, you Overcast, reroll the die, and add to the total. You escalate your Divine Wrath by one step for each Casting Check rolled after the first This accumulates until you have cast your miracle or ended it prematurely.
1. Petty Wrath
2. Great Wrath
3. Cataclysmic Wrath, adding +5 to the roll on the table for each additional step
An Impatient Lord
If all of your dice roll a one, your miracle automatically fails, and worse still, you escalate your Divine Wrath by three steps.
The Stress of Sinners
If you decide you do not want to roll your Divine Wrath, you gain Stress equal to double the steps of your Divine Wrath.
Miracle Working Modifiers
If any effects would hamper speech but not mute (i.e., being Deafened), receive a minus one to each casting Check; for every -10%, you would have to Check.
________________
Spontaneous Miracles
The Gods are not to be trifled with. To create a Spontaneous Miracle, begin by making a sentence with one of the three techniques, and combine it with a Presence of a God you Worship.
* “I Bless …”
* e.i. Empower or Revitalize
* “I Curse …”
* e.i. Weaken or Expel
* “I Commune …”
* e.i. Enlighten or Forsee


Spontaneous casting starts at CH 0; with every ten Hits rolled, you may add effect.
________________


Divine Wrath
When you roll Divine Wrath that includes Presence in its description, replace it with one of your God’s Presences.




Example: a Divine Eruption would erupt with a cleansing flame for Dominus, or Divine Backlash would lash out with hunting trophies for Bygorr.
