Character Creation
The gods are cruel, and danger is everywhere. Here are the three steps for creating a Descendent. It is recommended to roll your next Descendent as well.


* Step 1: Roll Starting Abilities. Roll d20 ten times; then assign to any ability requiring a d20.
* Step 2: Gain three Genetic Traits.
* Step 3: Select two Lineages available to your line, and add +10% to every listed Ability from each of your Lineages.
Luck
The fates are capricious, callous, as likely to grant you success in your endeavors as they are to consign you to a terrible fate. Luck is spent in two ways:
1. After a Check is rolled, you may spend it at a one-to-one ratio to raise or lower your roll.
2. You may spend 50 Luck to safely escape the situation.


Luck Checks may be rolled to decide random events. At the end of every session, you gain a d10 Luck, up to 100.
Max Encumbrance
Your back is killing you and your limbs are slow. You need to drop some weight before you move. When you exceed your Max Encumbrance in carried items, you suffer the following effects.
* Past 1x Enc: 1/2 Speed, -20% to all Checks.
* Past 2x Enc: No Speed, -40% to all Checks.
Instant Access Items
You pull the dagger out of its sheath with a swift motion, before driving it into their eye socket. You may wield these items without using an action.
Magick / Faith
Beware the horrors of this ancient and eldritch power. You may only have one of these two abilities.
