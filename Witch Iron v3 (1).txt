Conflict Resolution
There are three main methods of resolving conflicts.
* Whatever’s Reasonable: If a conflict does not have a meaningful consequence or the solution would reasonably work, then don’t roll; it just works.
* Ability or Skill Check: If a conflict has a binary outcome or brevity is desired, make a Check, possibly modified by the situation.
* Quarrel: If a conflict has many possible outcomes or a detailed outcome is desired, make a Quarrel.
Dice Terminology
* + Hits: After succeeding on a Check, add Hits to the total.
* Doubles: Rolling the same number for the units and tens dice.
* ExplodingE: When you roll the maximum result on a die, roll it again and use the total.
* Extended Check: Multiple linked checks, building up to a number of Hits.
* Reverse: Swaps the tens and units die before roll modifications from Luck.
Scope of Checks
When you make a Check, use whatever the result is for all related checks until the situation meaningfully changes. Basically, you should only roll once for a given Check (i.e., Picking a Lock, you either pick it or you can’t).


There are some obvious exceptions to this rule, for example, combat.
Player Agency
After a Check that fails, the player should be given the choice of at least two potential outcomes (I.e., vs. Picking a Lock, failure: I can’t pick this lock, or I can but I alert enemies).
Checks
You succeed on a Check by rolling percentile dice (d100 or 2d10) using one for the ten’s die and the other for the unit’s die, equal to or under a Skill or Ability; if you roll over, you fail.

On a success, use the result of the tens die as your number of hits on success. So, if you passed a check with a roll of 42, you score +4 Hits.

On a failure, subtract the result of the tens die from the tens unit of your Skill or Ability as your number of Hits. So, if you failed a check with a roll of 63 and had a 56 in the Skill, you scored -1 Hit.

Doubles are Critical Hits on a successful check and are Fumbles on a failed check.

If you roll 01-05, you always get a Critical Hit, and if you roll 95-00, you always get a Fumble.


Critical Hits and Fumbles always grant a total of +/-6 Hits for your Check.

Quarrels
A system to resolve conflicts quickly. This can be any dispute, such as bartering, preventing a wolf attack, finding a new contact, interrogation, swaying an audience, manipulation, chases, or even combat.
* Agree to Terms,
“If I win, you'll do ... If you win, I'll do...“
* Make a Contested Check
* Resolve the Argument
* Net Hits: -1, Failure
* Net Hits: 0 to 2, Victory at a Cost
* Net Hits: 3+, Victory
LingeringL Quarrels
If a Quarrel is Lingering, record its name, ability percentage & Hit bonus. It will then instigate a Quarrel at set intervals.
Lingering
	Set Interval
	Removed By:
	Disease
	When you Sleep.
	Defeating in a Quarrel, Cure
	Need Deprived*
	After Time Interval.
	Fulfilling Needs
	*Also escalates by 20% & +1 Hits at each interval.
Scope of Quarrels
When making a Quarrel, use whatever the result is for all related checks until the situation changes. You should only roll once for a given Quarrel (i.e., vs. Cliff, “If I win, I’ve climbed up”; use this for the entire climb).
Player Agency
After a Quarrel that ends in a Compromis, the player should always be given the choice of at least two potential outcomes (I.e., vs. Cliff on a -2 Hits the choice between falling part way down, suffering 2d6 damage, or losing their sword).
Compromise Examples
Here are examples to help you adjudicate Quarrels. Don’t take these as hard rules; make them your own.

	Take Your Silver
	d6 x 10 Silver
	d6 x 50 Silver
	*Delayed by Days / Weeks / Months depending on the length of the journey.
Group Quarrels
When a group is involved in a Quarrel, you have two ways of resolving it.
* Each character in the group individually Checks against a single opposed Check (i.e., vs. Cliff “If I win, I climbed up”).

The Dark Descent
Your lineage is doomed to corruption by one of the many demons of the dark gods. You choose which demon will corrupt their lineage, each one with their own unique powers and goals. Each generation, the players have the opportunity to learn a part of the demon's true name. The ultimate goal of the lineage is to either serve the dark gods or to truly defeat the demon by learning its true name and manifesting it.
Why?
The demon seeks to corrupt the descendants to gain their loyalty and use them as pawns in their eternal struggle against the other dark gods. The demon may be seeking to escape its own prison or curse, and corrupting the descendants is a way of doing so. The demon may also see the descendants as a way to gain access to the mortal realm.
The Exchange
Players can choose to use The Exchange to reroll any check, but it comes at a cost. You will not be able to use the exchange again until you roll on your demonic influence table.
Naming the Beast
Each generation, players can go to the edges of sanity and overcome challenges to gain a part of the demon's true name. The challenges are based on the type of demon the player's character has chosen. If you’re successful, roll on your true name table & demonic trait table tied to that word. Each generation can gain one part of the demon’s name.
Channel the Name
If a descendant knows a part of the demon’s true name, they can channel the demon for special abilities based on the type of demon it is. Each word of the demon's true name is tied to one of the demon’s powers, and these powers can be used by making a Quarrel against one Hit per word known, or roll on your demonic influence table.
Damnation
Damnation comes in two forms: losing one's mind or body to corruption or madness, or becoming an abomination. The abomination transformation is a powerful form granted by the demon, offering a boost of short-term power but at the cost of the descendant's soul. You may transform at any time, this is irreversible, and the descendant is damned forever. As an abomination, they have full access to all known demonic traits and use 5 Hits as their roll for any Check. If a descendant is damned, they can be used by the demon beyond their natural lifespan.
The Ultimate Outcome
The lineage is doomed to serve the dark gods or to truly defeat the demon by learning its true name and gaining control over it. Once your line has learned all eight parts of the demon's true name, you may shout its full name, summoning the demon to overcome it directly. This will be a battle between the player's character and the demon, the outcome of which will determine the fate of the lineage.


There are two ways this battle can happen:


1. The demon will claim the line if eight of the descendants are corrupted. Manifesting itself to directly claim the last descendant. If the demon wins, the line is damned, but if you defeat it, your line’s fate is delayed until the next descendant falls to the darkness.
2. You may choose to fight the demon using the true name, if you win, the line dominates the demon, gaining full access to its powers and never having to roll on the demonic influence table again. If the descendant loses, they become damned.


The end result will depend on the choices the player's character makes throughout the game.
