Campaign Options:
Apocalypse
It is the End Times, the Dark God’s machinations will come to fruition, and the setting will meet its doom. The group should decide what form this inevitable end will take and how much time is left, typically 100, 200, or 300 years. Use the following table for ideas, or create your own.


- The End Times-
	1
	Their Champion gathers an army, clad in black, and butchers the land.
	2
	The Barrier to their realm is sundered, spilling forth countless horrors.
	3
	The Hidden Empire beneath our feet reveals itself and conquers.
	4
	Corruption claims the hearts of the people, and society eats itself alive.
	5
	A Great Divinity falls, and the impact of their body scourges the land
	6
	The First Lich awakes, cursing every corpse to rise as a frenzied servant.
	7
	The Seven Seals are broken, each one bringing doom to the land.
	8
	The Sun is snuffed out, life no longer grows, and madness rules.
	9
	The Dance of Death grips the land, spreading to all who witness.
	10
	The Wilds claim vengeance, using tides of beast-kin, ship-sized uber-wolves, and the wrathful forest.

Is This the End?
If the Apocalypse is not halted, this is the natural end of the campaign. However, if the group decides they would like to continue, I offer two potential paths:
1. Continue? Your Lines survive into the new Post-Apocalyptic landscape.
2. New Game+ Your Lines are sent back to begin again, starting with any two Lineages you’ve unlocked

Monster Qualities

* A Mob may attack all opponents within their normal engagement range & ignore Overwhelm.
* When dealt an area attack, multiply all Wounds inflicted by 1+1 for every 5ft(r). (i.e x3 for 10ft(r))
* A Mob’s scale is reduced when its Max Wounds are equal to a lower scale value (i.e. small at x5).
