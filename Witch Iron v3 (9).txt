Magick
When you want to cast a spell, you must draw upon the power of the Wicked Winds and focus it on your desired effect. Using an action to Cast, roll up to your Magick in d10s. If the result is equal to or greater than the spell’s Casting Hits, it is cast successfully.  If the result exceeds the spell’s CH, you may continue to make Cast Checks in an Extended Check until the spell is cast.
Curse of the Wicked Winds
You feel the eldritch energies coiling and twisting inside you, just waiting to be released. You escalate your miscast by one step for each Casting Check rolled after the first. This accumulates until you have cast your spell or ended it prematurely.
1. Petty Miscast
2. Great Miscast
3. Cataclysmic Miscast, adding +5 to the roll on the table for each additional step
The Apprentice’s Folly
If all of your dice roll a one, your spell automatically fails, and worse still, you escalate your Miscast by three steps.
A Slow Death
If you decide that you do not want to roll your Miscast, then you gain Corruption equal to double the steps of your Miscast.
Spellcasting Modifiers
If any effects would hamper speech or movement but not mute or immobilize (i.e., being Deafened), receive a -1 to each casting Check; for every -10%, you would have to Check & -1 per AV of the most armored location.
________________
Spontaneous Spells
The Wicked Winds are a dangerous and malleable force. To create a Spontaneous Spell, begin by making a sentence with one of the three techniques, and combine it with a Domain of a wind you control.
* “I Create …”
* e.i. Creating or Summoning
* “I Purge …”
* e.i. Destroying or Banishing
* “I Command …”
* e.i. Controlling or Transforming
