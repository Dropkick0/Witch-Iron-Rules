Passing Genes
The laws of nature are written in runes of flesh and blood. You cannot change these laws. For the first Descendant in a Line of Lineage or when a Descendant is indirectly related, roll three Genetic Traits (rerolling duplicates) and record these in order in Genetic Trait slots 1, 2 & 3.


A Descendant has a 50% chance of gaining their Progenitor’s Genetic Trait for slots 1, 2 & 3. Otherwise, roll a random Genetic Trait for that slot.


When rolling for a Genetic Trait, check if the roll is even or odd. When even, gain the Base Trait, and when odd, gain the Duality Trait.

Gain +10% to the following Abilities:
Finesse, Intelligence, Willpower, Luck


Starting Trappings:
















Lineage Talents:
Forbidden Inspiration
You have delved into the dark arts, learning secrets that are better left unknown. Once per session, you may reroll any check or table, but each time you use this ability, you suffer 1 point of stress.
Polyglot
You are fluent in a variety of languages, and can quickly learn new ones. You are fluent in any language you have been exposed to, and it takes you only 1 day to learn a new language with the help of a speaker or written text.
Sage Advice
You are skilled at giving advice, and can help others make the most of their actions. Once per turn, you may spend an action instructing another character, granting them an additional action to use on their turn. If the target ignores your instruction, you may make a verbal attack roll to try and persuade them, using your net hits as the bonus to the additional action if successful.
________________
Just As Planned
You have a gift for seeing the future, and can prepare for any situation that may arise. Once per session, you may make a research check modified by the likelihood of the solution. If successful, your preparations take effect perfectly. If you fail, your preparations still take effect, but at a cost. The likelihood of success and the cost of failure are as follows:
* Likely: +20% & suffer 1 Stress
* Unlikely: +0% & suffer 2 Stress
* Absurd: -20% & suffer 3 Stress
Augmented Limb
You have learned how to fashion a limb into a multifunctional research assistant that sometimes acts on its own. This new limb replaces any of your existing limbs or missing limbs, and retains all normal functions. Once per session, you may allow the limb to reverse one of your failed research checks. Any future lost limbs may be replaced by spending 1 month researching and fashioning a new one.

Lineage Talents:
Devil’s Brew
You are skilled at creating powerful, but dangerous potions. You may add your Tier in +Hits to brewing for a new Concoction. For each Concoction brewed this way suffer one Stress, +one for each previous Devil’s Brew.
Rapid Alchemy

Precise Dilution
You have mastered the art of diluting potions, poisons, and other alchemical substances without diminishing their potency. This process takes 1 week of work and 1 relevant ingredient per copy (such as tree sap for healing potions or mercury for metal acids). In addition, you may brew any potion you have a recipe for with a check that is one tier lower than your own. You can also create a recipe for any potion you brew, detailing all of its effects and toxicity.
________________


Hidden Stockpile
You have a secret stash of alchemical substances that you can draw upon in a pinch. Once per session, you may spend the cost in silver and make a trade check to pull out a commonly known potion or one that you have created. If you fail, the potion evaporates harmlessly in your hand.
Grafted Limb
You have grown a new limb using strange alchemical concoctions. This new limb replaces any existing limb or missing limb, and retains all normal functions. You may secrete any commonly known potion or one that you have created once per limb, each session. Any future lost limbs may be replaced by spending 1 month growing and grafting a new one.
